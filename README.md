# ML_Simulator

## Machine Learning IDE

### Overview

ML_Simulator is a fully customizable Machine Learning IDE that lets you design, train, and test machine learning models using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Drawing inspiration from frameworks like PyTorch, this IDE offers a flexible and powerful environment for prototyping and experimentation.

### Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Model Creation:** Visually build ML models by connecting nodes.
- **Customizable Components:** Easily incorporate features such as batch normalization, dropout, and various activation functions.
- **Python-like Functionality:** Enjoy robust numerical computing with libraries that mirror Pythonâ€™s capabilities.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Train your models and analyze performance metrics directly within the IDE.
- **Enhanced Visualizations:** Visualize training progress and model outputs with built-in tools.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system)
- Required Python libraries (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for details)

#### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DisDoh/ML_Simulator.git
cd ML_Simulator
```

#### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To launch ML_Simulator, simply run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

After starting the application, use the drag-and-drop interface to build and configure your ML models. Train your model and evaluate its performance using the integrated tools.

### Roadmap

- **Real-Time Training Visualization:** Implement live updates during training sessions.
- **Prebuilt Model Templates:** Introduce templates for popular architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, etc.
- **Model Export/Import:** Add features for exporting and importing trained models.
