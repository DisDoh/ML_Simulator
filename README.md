# ML_Simulator
Machine Learning IDE

## Overview
ML_Simulator is a fully customizable Machine Learning IDE built using Godot 4.3. It enables users to design, train, and test machine learning models with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Inspired by frameworks like PyTorch, this IDE is designed to be both flexible and powerful.

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Model Creation**: Build ML models by visually connecting nodes.
- **Customizable Components**: Supports batch normalization, dropout, activation functions, and more.
- **Full Python-like Functionality**: Uses [NumpyForGDScript](https://github.com/DisDoh/NumpyForGDScript) for numerical computing.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train models directly within the IDE and analyze performance.
- **Godot Integration**: Leverage Godot's capabilities to enhance simulations and visualizations.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Install [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DisDoh/ML_Simulator.git
  cd ML_Simulator
  ```
- Install dependencies if required (refer to documentation inside the repo).

## Usage
1. Open Godot 4.3 and load the ML_Simulator project.
2. Drag and drop components to build your ML model.
3. Configure model parameters in the editor.
4. Train the model and evaluate results using built-in tools.

## Roadmap
- Implement real-time training visualization.
- Add prebuilt model templates (CNN, RNN, etc.).
- Support export/import for trained models.
